  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Considerations for all exams:</em></strong></p>
<div><strong>Universal Precautions:</strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Commonly called Standard Precautions</li>
  <li>Established by the Center for Disease Control to prevent infection and confine germs</li>
  <li>Protects the patient AND the caregiver</li>
  <li>Includes hand washing, equipment cleaning and protective equipment</li>
  <li>Linens and pillowcases should be changed after each patient</li>
  <li>Wearing a mask
    <ul>
      <li>Do not touch the part of the mask that will touch your face</li>
      <li>Tie
        the upper strings over the ears and towards the top of the back of your head</li>
      <li>When finished, remove the gloves first, and then untie the bottom strings,
followed by the top strings</li>
      <li>Discard the
        mask properly and wash your hands</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gowns are worn if soiling of clothing is likely from blood or body fluids
    <ul>
      <li>Wear gowns that are long and large to cover clothing</li>
      <li>Wash your hands and
        put the mask on before putting on a gown</li>
      <li>Remove all watches and jewelry before putting
        on a gown  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Hand Washing:</strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Wash hands using antibacterial soap with extra care to nails, knuckles and between fingers</li>
  <li>Say your ABCs or sing Happy Birthday to assist in washing for the proper length of time (at least 15 seconds)</li>
  <li>Washing should be performed for all of the following situations:    
    <ul>
      <li>Contamination - Immediately wash the affected area with soap and water, notify your 
        supervisor and immediately report to occupational health to file an exposure report</li>
      <li>After gloves removed</li>
      <li>Between patient contact</li>
      <li>After changing exam table linens or paper  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<strong>Personal Hygiene:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Jewelry should be removed while working</li>
  <li>Porcelain or artificial nails are not
    permitted</li>
  <li>Masks are designed for use with a single patient and should not be worn all day</li>
  <li>If you are ill, you should not come to work<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<div><strong><em>Patient Infection Control and Isolation:</em></strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Standard precautions should also be applied in all of the situations below</li>
  <li>Always disinfect the equipment and wash your hands before and after leaving the isolation room</li>
</ul>
<em>1. Respiratory Isolation</em>
<ul>
  <li>AKA droplet precautions</li>
  <li>Used to protect others from germs in the   patient's nose, mouth, throat, and lungs</li>
  <li>It is used for diseases that   are airborne</li>
  <li>Mask required for staff; some types of pneumonia, mumps,   rubella</li>
</ul>
<em>2. Reverse Protective Isolation</em>
<ul>
  <li> AKA protective environment precautions</li>
  <li>Protects patients from the   germs of others</li>
  <li>It is used  to protect patients with a history of chemotherapy, neutropenia, recent organ transplant or immunodeficiency (AIDS, leukemia)</li>
  <li>Masks for those with cough or   cold, no flowers or plants</li>
</ul>
<em>3. Strict Isolation</em>
<ul>
  <li> AKA airborne precautions</li>
  <li>Separation from others to prevent the   spread, by contact or airborne transmission, of highly contagious   diseases</li>
  <li>Requires use of personal respirator for staff/visitors</li>
  <li>TB,   Varicella, Shingles</li>
</ul>
<em>4. Enteric Precautions</em>
<ul>
  <li>Used in diseases involving ingestion of disease-producing   microorganisms to protect others from germs in the patient's bowels,   bladder, and stomach</li>
  <li>Gloves and gown required</li>
  <li>Certain GI and enteric   infections</li>
</ul>
<em>5. Wound-Skin Precautions</em>
<ul>
  <li>AKA contact precautions</li>
  <li>Used to protect others from germs in   patient's wounds or any other heavily contaminated areas</li>
  <li>Require gown   and gloves for any type of patient contact</li>
  <li>All protective equipment should be disposed of in the marked container before leaving the patient room</li>
  <li>MRSA, VRE, Scabies, Impetigo</li>
  </ul>
<p><img src="images/anatomy/disease.jpg"></p>
<strong>Transducer Disinfection:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>Medical devices are categorized for disinfection based on their use</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-Critical devices come in contact with intact skin (standard fetal echo probes)</li>
    <li>Semi-Critical devices come in contact with high  risk patients, non-intact skin or mucous membranes (endovaginal, endorectal and transesophageal probes)</li>
    <li>Critical devices 
      are used in  a sterile field or within blood vessel (intraoperative or intravascular transducers)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Low or Intermediate disinfection (EX: Saniwipes or T-spray) performed for transducers used for standard exams over intact skin</li>
  <li>High Level Disinfection refers to the use of a chemical solution on a transducer to reduce or eliminate all microorganisms, except bacterial spores</li>
  <li>A high level disinfectant (HLD) refers to the chemical used to remove all viable microorganisms from a surface</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The factors to consider when choosing a high level disinfectant are transducer
      compatibility, ventilation requirements, disinfection time, rinsing requirements,
      temperature, re-use period, cycle cost, neutralization requirements</li>
    <li>Examples include Metricide, Cidex, Glutaraldehyde, Ortho-phathaldehyde (OPA), Hydrogen peroxide</li>
    <li>Always wear the recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting the transducer</li>
    <li>Clean debris from the transducer with a towel and mild soap, test the temperature of the HLD, soak, rinse and place in storage</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Certain chemicals are unsafe to use on the transducer due to the potential for deterioration of the matching layer and glues used to assemble the transducer</li>
  <li>Never immerse the electrical component of the transducer in the disinfectant</li>
  <li>Sprays and wipes are NOT acceptable for high level disinfection</li>
  <li>Sterilization refers to the complete destruction of all living organisms on an object using exposure to heat, chemicals, or radiation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Needle guides on transducers are CRITICAL devices that require sterilization after each patient</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Transducers cannot be thermally sterilized because heating the PE element above the Curie point can cause it to lose its piezoelectric properties; PZT has a Curie point of 300 - 400 degrees Celsius</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Sonographer Responsibilities:</strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Always verify you are scanning the correct patient
    <ul>
      <li>Outpatients - use birth date</li>
      <li>Inpatients - use hospital wristband and patient chart </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Confirm the script matches the exam that is scheduled</li>
  <li>Review any prior pertinent diagnostic exams and reports</li>
  <li>Take a detailed patient history</li>
  <li>Explain the exam to the patient and discuss the time frame for results</li>
  <li>Present pertinent history and prior reports/cases to radiologist</li>
  <li>Accurately record measurements and comments on tech worksheet</li>
  <li>Indicate any necessary information regarding patient follow up</li>
  <li>Disinfect the transducer and machine with a Saniwipe or other approved disinfectant after each patient</li>
  <li>Gel bottles should be sanitized daily using disinfectant cleanser</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong><em>Sonographer Communication:</em></strong></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>1.  ALWAYS verify that you have the proper patient for the requested exam </p>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask the patient to confirm their name and date of birth prior to starting the exam</li>
    <li>When performing exams on inpatients, use the patient wrist band to verify the patient name and medical record number</li>
    <li>If a patient is unconscious and without a wristband, you must confirm the patient identity by contacting their nurse</li>
    <li>If a patient cannot be verified, do NOT perform the exam and reschedule the exam until verification can be accomplished </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p>2. Confirm script matches exam scheduled</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>When the suspected diagnosis is not able to be evaluated by the exam that is ordered, contact the referring physician to clarify the order</li>
    <li>The exam can always be rescheduled but it is not the Sonographers role to CANCEL an exam</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>3. Explain the exam or procedure and answer questions related to how the exam is performed</p>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Always consider the patient's mental state, age and other factors that may affect their ability to understand the exam explanation</li>
    <li>A patient with dementia or Alzheimer's disease may be more comfortable with a family member or something familiar in their room;  check with the patient's nurse for tips on communicating with the patient </li>
    <li>A patient that appears unconscious should still be offered a short explanation of the exam, especially when they have family members in the room</li>
    <li>Avoid  compromising the exam quality and scanning environment whenever possible</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p>4. Obtain pertinent history related to indication for current exam</p>
<p>5. Discuss when the patient can expect the results and that as a Sonographer you cannot provide any results for the exam; tell the patient they need to contact the physician that ordered the exam to obtain the results </p>
<p>6. Ask the patient if they have additional testing scheduled after this exam; offer to assist them with getting to their next exam</p>
<p>7. Accurately record measurements and comments on tech worksheet</p>
<p>8. Indicate any necessary info regarding patient follow up appointment date</p>
<p>****** NEVER provide clinical findings directly to the patient, this information must come from the physician</p>
<strong>Emergency Situations:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The role of fetal  sonographer is not to inform the patient of any findings on the exam</li>
  <li>Fetal hydrops and fetal demise are examples of critical findings on a fetal echo and you should find a  fetal cardiologist as soon as possible</li>
  <li>A nuchal cord and diaphragmatic hernia are important delivery considerations</li>
</ul>
<strong>CPR on a Pregnant Patient:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After 20 weeks  gestational age, the pregnant uterus can press against the inferior vena cava  and the aorta which limits venous return and cardiac output</li>
  <li>Extrinsic  compression of the IVC and venous return can produce hypotension or shock and  in the critically ill patient may precipitate cardiac arrest</li>
  <li>The  uterine size causes a compromise in venous return and cardiac output, which  limits the effectiveness of chest compressions</li>
  <li>The gravid uterus may be shifted away from the inferior vena cava  and the aorta by placing the patient 15° to 30° left oblique position or by  manually shifting the uterus to the left side    </li>
  <li>CPR
    <ul>
      <li>1. Call for help </li>
      <li>2.  Give 2 compressions </li>
      <li>3. Check and position airway </li>
      <li>4. Give 2 rescue breaths</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fetal monitoring is not important during maternal CPR</li>
  <li>Try to save the mother  first, then worry about the baby
  </li>
  <li>The American Heart  Association recommends 30 compressions for every 2 rescue breaths</li>
  <li>The  guidelines also state that you start single rescuer CPR with 30 compressions,  then reassess patient</li>
  <li>An overabundance of  magnesium sulfate can cause oliguria and cardiac arrest</li>
  <li>This medication is  used to prevent pre-term labor in patients with preeclampsia</li>
</ul>
<strong>Heimlich Maneuver:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>Choking rescue  technique is used to clear an airway obstruction caused by a foreign object in  adults and children</li>
  <li>A sonographer should inform the patient that she/he will  try to dislodge the foreign body</li>
  <li>The sonographer will position themself  behind the patient and wrap their arms around the patient in the subxiphoid  area</li>
  <li>Do NOT place hands on the belly over the uterus</li>
  <li>Care must be taken  not to break the xiphoid process so the hands should be placed slightly higher  on the breast bone just above where the lowest ribs join; chest compressions, not abdominal thrusts</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pre-term Labor:    </strong>
<ul>
  <li>Low amniotic fluid</li>
  <li>Frequent contractions</li>
  <li>The physician  should be alerted immediately and the patient should be assessed</li>
  <li>The nurse or  physician should  apply the fetal monitor and assess the patient</li>
  <li>Magnesium sulfate is commonly used to treat preeclampsia and prevent pre-term labor and will most likely  be administered to the patient before the fetal echo is resumed
  </li>
  <li>Indomethacin can also be used to stop early labor but offers an increased risk of early closure of the ductus arteriosus</li>
  </ul>
